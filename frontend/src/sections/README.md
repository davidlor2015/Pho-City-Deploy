# /src/sections

Sections are modular page fragments used inside pages.

Each section is a self-contained UI block that can include:

- Layout
- Tailwind styling
- Minimal logic

Example usage:

```tsx
import { Hero } from "@/sections/Hero";
import { MenuPreview } from "@/sections/MenuPreview";
```
